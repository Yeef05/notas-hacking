# Binary Search
## Descripción

Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!You can download the challenge files here:

## Notas adicionales

Prácticamente el juego se trata de reducir la cantidad de opciones a la mitad para que con los 10 intentos adivinar la flag
